# 19F + p Working Group

This repository contains materials and calculations related to the 19F + p reaction stduy at LUNA.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into several folders to help manage various aspects of the research:

### 1. Astrophysics

This folder contains the astrophysical modeling work, including:

- CNO and NeNa cycles integration to see how these cycles are interconnected with each other.
- Impact of new rates, with the primary goal to study the influence of the 19F + p reaction rate on these cycles.

### 2. Geant4

This folder holds Geant4 simulations for the BGO setup at LUNA. Originally developed for proton capture studies on carbon, this simulation has been adapted for the 19F + p reaction. It includes all the necessary code and geometry setups to simulate the detection of gamma rays from the reaction.

### 3. Feasibility

This folder includes calculations relevant to the feasibility study at LUNA:

- Estimation of reaction rates under LUNA conditions, including beam current, target thickness, and expected counting rates.
- Contains up-to-date cross-section extrapolations of both the (p,γ) and (p,α) channels and some of the newest literature data for the (p,γ) channel.

### 4. Slides

This folder contains all presentations made for the working group togheter with the minutes.

### 5. Implanted Target

This folder is dedicated to the study of the implanted 19F targets, mainly by SRIM calculations.
